## Description

This is my Full Stack portfolio created with React! I had so much fun toying around with this. I used this project as a vehicle to challenge myself to build something different. Learned how to render 3D models and make them interactable in a browser environment. Navigate my projects and experience by spinning the paper plane around the island. Massive shoutouts to the artists on Sketchfab for the excellent open source models.

## Technologies Used

React, Threejs for 3D components, TailwindCSS, emailjs, react router, react three/fiber and react three/drei to help with using threejs in react, and finally vite for the build.
